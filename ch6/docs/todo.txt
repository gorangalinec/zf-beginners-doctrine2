1. When an item is display for update, if the display status is visible, 1, the display until date still does not 
show up, until the visibility is turned off then back on. Maybe I can simulate this somehow--like sending a message of 'update
the date info now'?

Thougts: The displayuntil date does not show because the style is "display: none" by default even if the displaystatus is '1'.
When the displaystatus is toggled to 'hidden' (0) and then back to 'visible' (1), the style changes to "display: block" and
the month/day/year selects appear.

Should the first paramter to this javascript routine be changes?
  handleInputDisplayOnSelect('DisplayStatus', 'divDisplayUntil', new Array('1'));
Compare with Vikram's code. Compare with the css file for the form, too.

2. Do I need to remove/unset properties that are not part of the actual update (or create) form before it is populated?
